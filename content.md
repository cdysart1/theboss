#Queue ADT

The Queue ADT is a container for multiple elements. Those elements are ordered (i.e., they are arranged in a sequence) and may repeat (unlike a mathematical set)


#Linked List DS

A Linked List is a data structure, meaning a concrete programmatic way of managing information in memory. They can be used to implement a number of ADTs, including Queues, Stacks, Lists, and others.

Linked Lists are collections of nodes — wrapper structures which encapsulate a value and one or more pointers (references) to other nodes. The Linked List instance typically only has a reference to a so-called handle node, e.g. the head (first node) — it has no direct knowledge of other nodes in the list. However, the handle then points to a next node, which itself points to another next node, and so on and so forth. A list ends when a node's next pointer is null or undefined. The act of starting from a handle and visiting nodes in sequence is known as "traversing" a linked list.

Linked Lists can come in various flavors. For example, in doubly-linked lists, each node might point both to the next node and to the previous node as well. In some variations, the parent Linked List instance might maintain both head and tail references.
