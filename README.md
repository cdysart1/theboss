# NODE LEGO

## [nodelego.com](https://nodelego.tech)
Node Lego is a dynamic web application for visualizing data structures, designed as a tool for developers and students. Users can create and edit data structures including binary search trees, linked lists, stacks and queues, and may login and save their data structures for future reference. They may upload CSV files to render the data structure of their choice. Finally, a binary search tree demo provides a visual representation of various depth-first traversals.
